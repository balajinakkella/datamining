datamining Abstract.

Text classification is currently popular in Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Machine Learning (ML). 

KDD based text classification research focuses on statistical techniques, while the ML based approach focuses on 

artificial-intelligence techniques. Text mining necessitates the pre-processing of the documentbase. Two broad approaches 

can be identified: (1) document representation and (2) feature selection. In this paper, we propose three text 

pre-processing approaches: (a) pruned (two-frequency-threshold based) bag of single-words; (b) emerging pattern based bag 

of single-words; and (c) bag of frequent-wordsets. The core strategy to develop these three approaches is to avoid 

computational overhead of (2). Experiments indicate acceptable text classification accuracy when applying these 

approaches.
